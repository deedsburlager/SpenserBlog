            <h3>My Road to an Allergy Friendly Life</h3>
            <p>I have loved gluten for my whole life. Unfortunately, gluten has not loved me back. For my entire life I have struggled with what I thought to be IBS, and having bouts of severe cramping, vomiting, dizziness, getting the shakes, breaking into a cold sweat, and…(ahem)...bathroom trouble. (I can not believe I just admitted that to the whole internet. You’re welcome.) I tried everything from eliminating sugar to eating more gluten because I thought ‘something plain’ would settle my stomach. Ha. </p>
            <p>It wasn’t until my second year of college that my roommate suggested I might have a problem with gluten. She and her entire family had issues with it, and maybe if I eliminated it from my diet, I would begin to feel better too. Holy gluten, Batman. It sure did help.</p>
            <p>But, nixing gluten from my diet didn’t cure me entirely. I could tell I felt so much better, but something still wasn’t right. So I paid a visit to my roommate’s doctor at the Manna Institute in Columbus, Ohio. He told me he was going to conduct something called an MSA test on me (Meridian Stress Assessment). I am sure it is very scientific, but from my perspective, he used a wet metal rod and touched it to different spots on my hands, printed out a list of foods he said I was intolerant of, and said I had high levels of heavy metals, and parasites in my system. Super. (I realize when I explain all this it sounds very woo-woo, but trust me, it helped!)</p>
            <p>With nothing left to lose (except hundreds of my favorite foods) I set out to completely cut off anything on the list he gave me. This included corn, pasteurized cow’s milk, pork, soy, gluten, wheat, yellow cheese, cantaloupe, honeydew, MSG, and the list went on. Eating out was a nightmare, family gatherings were stressful, and cooking for myself on a college campus was laughable. I basically survived on microwaved beans and rice for months.</p>
            <p>But. My symptoms were gone! I finally felt good and healthy. For the first time in my life, I did not have to fear leaving the house in case I was struck down by something awful! As long as I knew what was in what I was eating, I was safe. Thus began my journey into allergy free living.</p>
            <p> Foods that had just seemed normal, now were teeming with hidden dangers (like ketchup, why corn syrup in ketchup!) And soy. Soy is in <b>absolutely everything</b>. But, I learned the code names for all my allergies (what up, maltodextrin) and I learned to make things from scratch. My allergies, which have been a hindrance all my life, have actually turned into a blessing! In the past I may have relied on a box mix or something pre-made, but now I can analyze any food I want to make, and figure out how to make it from scratch, using ingredients that I know I can eat safely. </p>
            <p>My allergies have also helped me connect with and bless others who also have allergies. It can be really scary to try to make food for someone with allergies if you have no experience with allergy free cooking, and it can be equally scary as an allergy sufferer, to receive food, that may or may not make you sick. Knowing how to make food from scratch, using whole food ingredients, minimizes confusion and fear. This is exactly what I have learned to do since being diagnosed.</p>
            <p>Granted, it did take me time and patience to learn how to cook in this new way. Ask my husband, who still makes fun of me for the frozen jello or ‘ketchup spaghetti’ I made him when we were first dating. (Think: tomato paste and disintegrating rice noodles.)  Since then, I have learned a thing or two about cooking. For example, my Easy, Frugal, and Gluten Free Spaghetti and Meat Sauce is a much bigger hit than Ketchup Spaghetti ever was. Or try my Nostalgic Stovetop Chicken and Rice for a comforting weeknight dish!</p>
            <p>What about you? Have you had to overcome any food allergies in your own life or loved ones? Have any yummy allergy friendly recipes to share? </p>
