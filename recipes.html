                <h3>Easy, Frugal, and Gluten Free Spaghetti and Meat Sauce</h3>
                <p>Who doesn’t love a giant bowl of noodles? My mom is a spaghetti fanatic, and I think I inherited the spaghetti gene. Being gluten free, doesn’t stop me from eating my favorite foods and it certainly doesn’t stop me from eating spaghetti! </p>
                <p>It’s important to me to be able to know what is in my foods, while also keeping costs down. Often, I find that organic jars of marinara can be upwards of $5 or $6 dollars! This is ridiculous to me. You can make your own at home, just as easily, at a fraction of the cost. In my opinion, making at home makes it taste even better!</p>
                <p>There are plenty of ways to customize and make this recipe your own. Change out the herbs for your favorites, add a variety of vegetables, switch the beef for ground turkey or seitan. One of my favorite ways to make homemade marinara is to use fresh tomatoes from the farmers market and let it simmer all day….but ain’t nobody got time for that! This recipe uses canned tomatoes, but please, if you have the time, use 7-8 medium sized tomatoes, diced into small pieces, and simmer on low for a few hours with fresh herbs and onions. Your taste buds will thank you! </p>
                <p>Remember, cooking recipes are guidelines. If one of these ingredients does not work for you or your family, swap it out for something else, or leave it out all together! You are not made to serve the recipe, but the recipe serve you! </p>
                    <ul><h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4></ul>
                        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes (the same amount of canned diced (drained) will do in a pinch!)</li>
                        <li>1 can of tomato paste</li>
                        <li>2 TBS of diced garlic (from the jar or fresh)</li>
                        <li>1.5 lbs of ground beef, turkey, or sausage</li>
                        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
                        <li>1 pack of fresh sliced mushrooms (or two small cans, drained)</li>
                        <li>2 tbs each of fresh basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary (or 2-3 tsp of dried)</li>
                        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
                        <li>Oil for sauteing</li>
                        <li>1 package of gluten free spaghetti noodles (I love Tinkyada brand, but Aldi’s is just as good!)</li>
                    <ol><h4 class="directions">Directions</h4>
                        <li>Begin by dicing your onions, adding to a preheated and oiled pain (I use coconut oil), with all your uncooked ground beef, garlic, and mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Also add in any vegetables of your choosing. (I love using zucchini, spinach, or celery!)   Saute these on medium heat, breaking up the ground beef, and cook until ground beef is cooked through and vegetables are soft. (During this step I usually cook my noodles, but feel free to use gluten-full noodles, spaghetti squash, zucchini noodles..Noodle it up!)</li>
                        <li>Add in herbs, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste. Stir to combine.</li>
                        <li>Depending on how thick you like your sauce, you may need to add a bit of water, adding in ⅛ of a cup at a time.</li>
                        <li>Let this simmer on medium low heat for as long as you can, continuing to add in water the longer you allow it to simmer.</li>
                        <li>Serve over noodle of choice, with a green vegetable, and a large salad! (Click here for my favorite weeknight salad and dressing!)</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Try out this easy, frugal, and gluten free spaghetti and tell me what you think! Do you usually get store bought jars or make your sauce homemade? </p>

                <h3>Our Favorite Gluten-Free Blueberry Banana Muffins</h3>
                    <p>My toddler is a muffin fanatic, but there is something about a blueberry muffin that holds a special place in his little muffin loving heart (or stomach!). Since I am the only one in our house on a gluten free diet,  I could easily just buy a pack of muffins for him to have as the occasional treat, but I am not a huge fan of all the added ingredients, not to mention excess sugar, in the store bought variety! I don’t keep gluten-full flour in the house, so if Quill is wanting a muffin, than a homemade gluten free muffin will have to do! </p>
                    <p>This recipe for Quill’s favorite blueberry muffins is incredibly easy, only requiring a few easily found ingredients! I am not much of a baker (yet!) but even I can’t mess these yummy muffins up! Eat them for breakfast with a cup of coffee, or as a special afternoon snack with a nice big glass of homemade almond milk! These are perfect year round, but especially on a crisp fall day! There’s nothing like a nice warm muffin! </p>
                    <ul><h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4></ul>
                        <li>3 mushy bananas</li>
                        <li>1 egg</li>
                        <li>1.5 Cups of your favorite cup for cup gluten free flour (I love Bob Red Mills!)</li>
                        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                        <li>1 tsp baking powder (I find corn free at whole foods)</li>
                        <li>2 tsp of cinnamon</li>
                        <li>¾ cup of sugar (I use cane sugar) </li>
                        <li>1.5 tsp of vanilla</li>
                        <li>½ cup of coconut oil (or use regular butter if not dairy free)</li>
                        <li>1.5 cups of blueberries (frozen or fresh)</li>
                    <ol><h4 class="directions">Directions</h4>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. </li>
                        <li>Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside (gluten-free flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and sugar)</li>
                        <li>Using a hand or stand mixer and mix bananas, vanilla,and egg until thoroughly combined.</li>
                        <li>Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir in.</li>
                        <li>Add coconut oil to the mixture and combine.</li>
                        <li>Gently stir in blueberries (or chocolate chips if you fancy them! Or both, I won’t judge.)</li>
                        <li>Line a muffin tin with cups, or grease with coconut oil</li>
                        <li>Spoon in equal parts of the mixture to your muffin tin. I usually use a ¼ c measuring scoop.</li>
                        <li>Depending on your oven, bake for approximately 15 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean from the middle. </li>
                    </ol>
                <p>And that’s it! Now you have some tasty gluten free muffins to share! Or hide them on top of the refrigerator and eat them yourself. I won’t tell.</p>

            <h3>Fiesta Worthy Guacamole</h3>
            <p>There are very few things in life I love more than guacamole. Since I was a kid this stuff has been one of my favorite dips (And by dip I mean I dip my fork in it). I can remember lounging about with my sister asking each other silly questions, and she asked me if I could have a whole house filled with one food, what would it be? I said guacamole. And chocolate chip cookies. But that’s because I’m the rebel second child, and who wouldn’t love a guacamole/chocolate chip cookie house?</p>
            <p>This guacamole recipe has been honed to perfection over time. There is a very delicate balance of ingredients in guacamole that can take it from ‘give me a house full of the stuff’ to ‘what happened to the avocado, my mouth is on fire from jalapeno’. I have scientifically created what is the perfect green balance and now I am sharing it with you, dear reader. Thank me later. </p>
            <ul><h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4></ul>
                <li>4-5 medium avocados (or if you’re trying to fill a house, approximately 8,000)</li> 
                <li> 1 TBS of chopped jar garlic</li> 
                <li> ½ of a medium sized chopped red onion (it must be red. It’s worth it.)</li> 
                <li>½ cup of finely chopped fresh cilantro (also worth it.)</li> 
                <li>5-6 dashes of Tabasco (must be Tabasco brand, nothing else will do!)</li> 
                <li>Juice of 1 small lemon</li> 
                <li>Juice of 1 small lime</li> 
                <li>1 tsp of pink himalayan sea salt</li> 
                <ol><h4 class="directions">Directions</h4>
                    <li>Cut avocados and put the fleshy green bits into a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Smash the daylights out of them. Really this is a personal preference.</li>
                    <li>Add in remaining ingredients and stir to combine</li>
                    <li>Allow it to rest (after all, you just smashed the daylights out of it) in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Be sure to lay a piece of plastic wrap resting directly on top of the guacamole, sealing it, and also adding one to the top of your bowl to prevent browning. (I’ve heard mixed reviews about storing your guacamole with an avocado pit inside to prevent it browning, anyone have any experience with this?)</li>
                    <li>Eat with chips, or a fork like me!</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <p>How do you like to eat your guacamole? What food would you fill your house with?</p>
